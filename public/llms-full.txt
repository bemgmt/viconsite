## How It Works

### When Every Second Counts, Intelligence Wins

1. Detect: AI sensors recognize heat, smoke, and flame signatures. Advanced AI vision constantly monitors your property in real-time, identifying fire threats faster than traditional smoke detectors. Multi-spectrum sensors detect infrared signatures, smoke particles, and flame patterns within seconds.

2. Localize: Thermal imaging pinpoints the fire's origin for maximum efficiency. The thermal imaging system precisely calculates the fire's exact location, distance, and intensity. This data guides the suppression system to target the flame source with surgical accuracy, minimizing collateral water damage.

3. Suppress: The high-pressure cannon activates instantly, extinguishing flames before they spread. The VK-240-25-3000's 12 L/s high-pressure water cannon deploys with pinpoint accuracy. Automatic activation means there's no delay waiting for emergency services — protection happens in seconds.

4. Notify: You're alerted through the VICON App with live video verification and system status. The moment suppression activates, you receive an instant alert on your smartphone with live video feed of the incident, system status, and emergency contact options.
